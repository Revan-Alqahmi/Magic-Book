# Magic-Book

This is my project in the advanced programming course in UQU. 

The program is a collection of fictional stories in an electronic book that provides the feature of reading and listening to the stories. 
The program consists of several interesting interfaces supported by entertaining pictures and texts that are available for reading with the listening feature as well. It targets three categories: children, teenagers, and adults. The user benefits from learning and enjoying at the same time. 
Time so that his imagination and ideas develop smoothly, beautifully, and not boring. 

We used MySQL Workbench for the database in the backend and scenebuilder JavaFX for the frontend.
